# About this repository
Sometimes if I have enough free time, I like to work on some datasets. In this repository, I upload my practices on the random dataset.
<br>
I do like to save some of my interests during my weekend times.
The works which are uploaded in these repositories had done during my weekends.
Please feel free to use the codes or dataset as you want.
<br>
